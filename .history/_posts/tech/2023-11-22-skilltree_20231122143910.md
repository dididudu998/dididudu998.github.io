At the heart of the platform is the SkillTree Dashboard that acts as a Learning Management System (LMS) and enables to directly embedding SkillTree's Skills Display into one more existing/new web applications. SkillTree Platform supports both of these use-cases under a single installation of a SkillTree Dashboard - an organization can author multiple training profiles where some of these trainings are taken directly in the SkillTree's Dashboard and some are embedded into home-grown applications and taken/followed within those applications.
